# Deploying Hillview

The Hillview service architecture is shown in the following figure:

![System architecture](../docs/system-architecture.png)

This documentation describes how the Hillview service can be deployed.
These tools require `ansible` to be installed on the host running the
following commands, as well as the servers you are trying to deploy
to.  Ansible must be able to run commands on the servers.

Before you run these commands, make sure you've built both `platform`
and `web` projects.  The deployment scripts are in the `deployment`
folder:

```
$: cd deployment
```

## Service configuration

### Service parameters

The fixed configuration of the Hillview service is obtained from the
file `config.yaml`.  Currently this file stores the service port for
the Hillview service and the Java heap size.

Here is an example config.yaml file:

```
---
# Hillview service parameters
  # Network port where the servers listen for requests
  backend_port: 3569
  # Java heap size for Hillview service
  heap_size: "5000m"
  # Folder where the hillview service is installed on remote machines
  service_folder: "~"
  # Version of Apache Tomcat to deploy
  tomcat_version: "8.5.8"
  # Tomcat installation folder name
  tomcat: "apache-tomcat-{{ tomcat_version }}"
```

### Service machines

The cluster where the Hillview service is deployed is described by a
file containing the list of machines where the service should be
deployed.  Here is an example of such a file:

```
[web]
192.168.1.2

[backends]
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.4
```

The `web` group describes the front-end web server.

The `backends` group lists all machines running the `hillview` service.

### Service permissions

In this file we assume that the Hillview service runs under a user
account named `hillview`.  No special privileges are needed to run the
Hillview service.

## Deploying the service

In the following commands we assume that the file describing the list
of machines is named `hosts`.

You can verify that ansible is able to authorized commands on these servers:

```
$: ansible all -a "ls" -i hosts -u hillview
```

To install Java on all servers (only needed once):

```
$: ansible-playbook install-java.yaml -i hosts -u hillview
```

The following command installs the software on the machines:

```
$: ansible-playbook prepare.yaml -i hosts -u hillview
```

The service is started by running the following command:

```
$: ansible-playbook start.yaml -i hosts -u hillview
```

To verify if the services are up and running, open
`http://<ip-address-of-web-node>:8080` in your web browser.

To stop the services you can run:

```
$: ansible-playbook stop.yaml -i hosts -u hillview
```
