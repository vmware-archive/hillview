/**
 * This converter has a sorted array of strings defining some bucket boundaries and
 * a data range.  The first boundary corresponds to the minimum value, and the last
 * boundary corresponds to the max value.
 * We always expect that max - min >= boundaries.length.
 * The buckets have the left boundary inclusive and the right one exclusive,
 * except the last bucket which has the both boundaries inclusive.
 *
 * A string is converted to a number corresponding to the bucket in which it falls.
 * If a string is less than the first the result is less than min.
 * If a string is more than the last, the result is more than max.
